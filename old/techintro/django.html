Django
What is Django
----

<p><a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> is a web application framwork written in Python, supported by the Django Software Foundation. It follows the model-template-view pattern, which naturally separates the data (models), web-frontend (template) and the creation of the web-front-end (view).
The core Django framwork consists of an <a href="#info">object-relation mapper</a> where data models are defined using Python classes, and a database-abstraction API that makes changes to the data models easy.</p>
