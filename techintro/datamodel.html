Data model
Python classes as data models
----

<p>Data models are defined with Python classes. In this manner, we can define the data model of a relational database in a database independent manner.

<p>Furthermore, we can define arbitrarily complex constraints and custom fields.</p>

<p>Even more powerful is the ability to associate methods with our data models, enabling us to extend the power of relational databases with the flexibility offered by a programming language.</p>
