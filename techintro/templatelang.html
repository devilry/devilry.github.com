Template languages... Why?
----

<p>The Django template language makes creating HTML code a breeze.</p>

<p class="cite">
<span class="cite-text">Django's template language is designed to strike a balance between power and ease. It's designed to feel comfortable to those used to working with HTML.</span>

<p class="cite">
<span class="cite-text">If you have a background in programming, or if you're used to languages like PHP which mix programming code directly into HTML, youâ€™ll want to bear in mind that the Django template system is not simply Python embedded into HTML. This is by design: the template system is meant to express presentation, not program logic.</span>
