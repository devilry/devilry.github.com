<span class="cite-text">Object-relational mapping (ORM, O/RM, and O/R mapping) in computer software is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages.</span>

<p>Python classes are used to define data models that the Django ORM converts to relational datadbase models. The Django query langauge hides the SQL queries from the programmer, making a database switch very easy(<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/databases/"></a>). The Django query language is database independent, making a database switch very easy. Supported databases are PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Oracle.</p>

<p>ORM has some overhead compared to native SQL queries, but there are many optimization techniques avaialable in Django. Where maximum efficieny is needed, it's even possible to write RAW SQL statements.
