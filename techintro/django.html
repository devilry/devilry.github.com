<h3>What is Django</h3>

<p>Django is a web application framwork written in Python, suppored by the Django Software Foundation. It follows the model-template-view pattern, which naturally separates the data (models), web-frontend (template) and the creation of the web-front-end (view).
The core Django framwork consists of an object-relation mapper where data models are defined using Python classes, and a database-abstraction API that makes changes to the data models easy.
and the relational database details are hidden to the programmer by the Django query langauge.</p>

<p>Djangos query langauge hides the SQL queries from the programmer, making a database switch very easy.</p>
