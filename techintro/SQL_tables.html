SQL tables
SQL tables created from the Python models
----

<p>SQL tables are automatically created based on the Python classes.</p>

<p>SQL based relational databases all implement one form of SQL, however their implementations vary. We generate our database from our data model. The database abstraction layer generates the SQL for our database, and handles common sources of compatibility issues, such as index creation and constraints.</p>
